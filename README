This project uses Python (version 3.6.12) and the common Python library NumPy 
(version 1.19.1), as well as the re and math libraries that come standard
with Python. It was developed using the Sublime Text 3 text editor and run
on a Ubuntu system through the use of Windows Subsystem for Linux 2. 

To run this code: 

1) Ensure that Python and the required libraries are installed

2) Ensure that the Lab1_driver.py file is located in the same
directory as the Lab1_matrix_multiply.py and Lab1_utils.py files. This 
directory should also contain a subdirectory entitled "input". 

3) Open the Lab1_driver.py file and ensure that the paths on lines 19 
and 27 point to your desired input file and output file, respectively.

4) Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the Lab1_driver.py
file, and enter the command "python Lab1_driver.py". If your input file is valid,
your output will be written to the specified path. If not, you will receive an 
error describing the issue with the input file.
