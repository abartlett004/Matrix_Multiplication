# Python_Matrix_Multiplication
An assignment I completed as part of one of the classes in my bioinformatics master's program. The assignment was to read in a specifically  formatted input file of matrices, perform two different matrix multiplication algorithms, output the product matrix, and compare the efficiencies of the algorithms.
